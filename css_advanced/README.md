This is an advance html program code, where I have been given the task to replicate a page in Figma from scratch.

This project was previously a web page for a cooking school that provides information on courses, instructors, and recipes. Now, it will be replicating a figma file. The page is built using HTML and css.

 Installation and Usage

To use this code, you need a web browser such as Chrome, Firefox, or Safari. Simply download the code from the GitHub repository and open the index.html file in your browser.

 Documentation

The code is organized into different sections: instructions, instructors, and classes. Each section is unique.
